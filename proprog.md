# Strengths and Weaknesses of Kotlin

The bachelor project was an Android application with a standard Android front-end and a game engine running separately from the application. Kotlin was the main programming 
language for the project and was chosen over Java because it is trying to solve a lot of problems Java inherently has with its somewhat chaotic nature, its unintuitive way 
of writing code and the null exception problem. Kotlin is being heavily pushed onto developers by Google and other software companies are switching over. In the second year 
we had the course Mobile/Wearable Programming and we learned Kotlin instead of Java for Android development.  

## Strengths

Kotlin is a good programming language which has many strengths. When creating a program in Kotlin the number of written lines of code is less compared to writing the same program 
in Java. Kotlin havs a more intuitive syntax than Java which is easier to understand, increases readability and maintainability of the code. Kotlin was designed to be optimized 
towards two programming paradigms: object-oriented and functional programming. Asynchronous coroutines is incorporated into Kotlin to allow for easier code writing of asynchronous 
tasks. Coroutines seeks to be better and a replacement for RxJava. Kotlin has backwards-compatibility with Java and allows for the use of Java syntax inside the Kotlin code. The 
code is checked for errors and bugs at compile time so the developer will be notified if they have written illegal or incorrect syntax. Having the program syntax checked before 
runtime is good as some bugs can go more easily undetected or be more difficult to track down when the program is running.  

## Weaknesses

We feel that two of the biggest weaknesses Kotlin has is the lack of official documentation for certain components and it is difficult to get help with certain programmatic problems. 

The lack of certain documentation for e.g. Firebase makes progress with the implementation slow as one has to figure out how to convert code examples from Java to Kotlin and write 
it in a good way which fits with the current implantation/solution. Since fewer people use Kotlin compared to Java, getting help for specific problems connected to the Kotlin 
syntax is difficult and for the most part one have to figure out a solution to the problem for oneself. This makes writing code in Kotlin at times extremely time consuming.  

# Control of Process and Communication

For structuring the team we created two hierarchies the first hierarchy was for general group responsibilities i.e. group leader and secretary. The second was who had the main 
responsibility for a given system within the application. Combine these two hierarchies with the agile development method Scrum and you get the complete sandwich we used to 
structure ourselves in the project. We had daily sessions with each other every workday 09:00 to 16:00 and weekly 30 minute meetings on Mondays with the stakeholders and study 
supervisor. These hierarchies and timetables were created to improve the work conditions for all group members as having a general structure everyone can follow hinders uncertainty 
and confusion for everyone involved with the project.  

The previously mentioned structuring methods were used to control the development process: and primarily by following the Scrum methodology. The Scrum sprints, all planned and 
completed work related to the Scum process with e.g. product backlog were done through digital means, this also goes for everything else, all work in general related to the 
bachelor project. We feel that doing the bachelor project only through digital means in general went well, but it is not a complete replacement for psychical sessions. Because 
having psychical sessions allows for more direct communications and feedback as you can talk a lot more with your hands and use gestures. Ideas can quickly be drawn onto a 
whiteboard be discussed, scratched and changed. We substituted the whiteboard with Microsoft Whiteboard which is a digitized whiteboard where people can collaborate together. 
MS Whiteboard was mediocre to use and it is a lot more tedious to draw shapes and write down ideas in it, as you have draw with the mouse than compared a real psychical whiteboard. 
We mainly used Discord for communication between each other and Zoom for communication with stakeholders and the study supervisor. One of the main issues we had when communicating 
digitally is that it is a lot easier to talk over each other, which at times can be very annoying and frustrating.  
 
 Discord has its strength and weaknesses. Some of the main problems we ran into was when we shared the screen with each other, the text would be extremely blurry due to high resolution 
 of our monitors and the 720p quality limit for people without the premium service Nitro. We worked around this problem by scaling up the syntax in the IDE or by switching over to 
 Zoom where we could stream in high quality. Some of Discord positives were that it worked great for us with its voice connectivity as we had a primary voice channel dedicated to 
 project work and development. Discord's text messaging system worked great, important messages could be pinned in the main bachelor text channel so they would not go unnoticed.  
 
 Zoom was only used to handle commutations with the stakeholders and study supervisor and for the occasional screen share of code syntax when Discord were insufficient. Zoom's messaging 
 system is mediocre for a live chat, for sending notes and other important messages we had to use Discord since Zoom leaves a lot to be desired with its messaging system.  
 
 In reflection of this we feel that we did a good job with the commutation with each other, the stakeholders and study supervisor. We had good work conditions where we encouraged, 
 motivated and helped each other throughout the development process.
